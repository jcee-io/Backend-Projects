Several backend projects that I've recently created to polish and level up my backend skills. There are five small backend projects that showcase the interaction between Frontend and Backend.

## Project 1: Timestamp Microservice

This will immediately give you the unix time as well as the UTC time on the frontend

## Project 2: Request Header Parser

## Project 3: URL Shortener

## Project 4: Exercise Tracker

## Project 5: File Metadata Microservice
